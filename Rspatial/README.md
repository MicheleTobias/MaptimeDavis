# Rspatial

2:00-4:00 | Monday, October 16th, 2017 | DSI Classroom | room 360 Shields Library
https://spatial.ucdavis.edu/2017/10/09/maptimedavis-rspatial-org/

An introduction to R for geospatial topics with [RSpatial.org](http://rspatial.org) Learn to load, analyze, and visualize spatial data with a robust accessible online tutorial with the help of knowledgeable instructors.

### Prepare

 * Install R and Rstudio
 * Download all the code, data, and answers. https://github.com/MicheleTobias/MaptimeDavis/archive/master.zip
 * Unzip the data in the Rspatial folder.
 * *Note*: you may need to install packages, primarily sp,rgdal,rgeos and raster ```install.packages(c('sp','rgdal','rgeos','raster'))```

### Background Materials

Slide presentations on the topics:

 * [Vectors in R](http://gfc.ucdavis.edu/events/arusha2016/_static/talks/day1_5_spatial_1_vector.pdf)
 * [CRS in R](http://gfc.ucdavis.edu/events/arusha2016/_static/talks/day1_6_spatial_2_crs.pdf)
 * [Rasters in R](http://gfc.ucdavis.edu/events/arusha2016/_static/talks/day2_1_spatial_3_raster.pdf)
 * [Mapping in R](http://gfc.ucdavis.edu/events/arusha2016/_static/talks/day2_2_spatial_4_maps.pdf)
