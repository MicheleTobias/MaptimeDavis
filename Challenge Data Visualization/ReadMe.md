# Data Visualization Challenge!

The goal of this workhshop is to challenge you to create a data visualization in a limited amount of time.  Everyone gets the same datasets to work with and at the end of the time, we'll share our results to see what everyone was able to create.

# Rules
1. Use at least one of the required datasets.
1. Use any other additional datasets you choose.
1. Work alone or in a group.
1. You do not need to have a complete visualization at the end, but you should share what you've accomplished.
1. Recognize that sharing work completed under a time constraint is difficult, so we will be positive about the results people share.

# Required Datasets
Choose at least one of these datasets to work with.

1. Bigfoot Observations
1. Moon Tree Locations

# Helpful Datasets
These datasets may be useful.

1. Natural Earth Data
