# Data Visualization Challenge!

The goal of this workhshop is to challenge you to create a data visualization in a limited amount of time.  Everyone gets the same datasets to work with and at the end of the time, we'll share our results to see what everyone was able to create.

# Rules
1. Use at least two of the required datasets.
1. Use any other additional datasets you choose.
1. Work alone or in a group.
1. You do not need to have a complete visualization at the end, but you should share what you've accomplished.
1. Recognize that sharing work completed under a time constraint is difficult, so we will be positive about the results people share.

# Required Datasets
Choose at least two of these datasets to work with. [note: maybe we should mine these datasets: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday or http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/  or https://www.mapillary.com/app (click the brain button to search - from Christopher Beddow @c_beddow on Twitter) ]
