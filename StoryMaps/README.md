# StoryMaps Un-Workshop

We worked through two tutorials:

 1. ESRI's Training Materials for [Getting Started with ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/cea22a609a1d4cccb8d54c650b595bc4) - we found this one less helpful because it does not have example data to work with and required us to try to find our own data.
 
 1. Joseph Kerski's [A Hands-On Lesson in the New Story Maps Tools](https://community.esri.com/community/education/blog/2019/06/24/a-hands-on-lesson-in-the-new-story-maps-tools#) - the .zip file you can download at the bottom of the page contains all the example data, plus a PDF or Word file with the tutorial.  This is a good lesson for people with previous GIS experience.
