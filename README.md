# What is MaptimeDavis?
Maptime is literally time for maps. Take a couple of hours to learn something new or hone a skill you already have.  Everyone is welcome, from brand new learners through seasoned veterans.

## Why & how does Maptime work?
Maptime is a community.  It works when everyone contributes.  Contributions take the form of not only presenting, but attending events and sharing those events with others, making new connections, discussing what topics you want, and helping to make sure they happen.  Maptime isn't a intended to be a list of topics served up for you to consume provided by some campus entity, but rather a discussion you participate in.

# Call for Speakers
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDjQFZ7U_xNC5yYrlvwt1g3qBXzgFMizXIQXsu1HVD_OaYSQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">Nominate yourself or someone else as a speaker!</a>  

#maptimeDavis is proving to be a welcome opportunity for the Davis geospatial community to share and develop mapping skills.  The organizers at the UC Davis Library's Data Management Program and Center for Spatial Sciences welcome volunteers to present workshops and suggestions for who to contact about specific topics.

Is it ok if the topic has been covered in previous workshops?  YES!  New people find #maptimeDavis each week and no two instructors will teach any given concept in the same way.

Can I present in a team?  YES! 

How long are workshops typically?  We tend to schedule 2 hours, but it's adjustable.

I'm not an expert. Can I still present?  YES!  Experts are not always the best people to explain. Dedicated and proficient users of a tool are often better at teaching tools than the experts.

Have more questions?  Contact Michele Tobias at mmtobias@ucdavis.edu
