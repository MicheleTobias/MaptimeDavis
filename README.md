#maptimeDavis is proving to be a welcome opportunity for the Davis geospatial community to share and develop mapping skills.  The organizers at the UC Davis Library's Data Management Program and Center for Spatial Sciences welcome volunteers to present workshops and suggestions for who to contact about specific topics.

Is it ok if the topic has been covered in previous workshops?  YES!  New people find #maptimeDavis each week and no two instructors will teach any given concept in the same way.

Can I present in a team?  YES! 

How long are workshops typically?  We tend to schedule 2 hours, but it's adjustable.

I'm not an expert. Can I still present?  YES!  Experts are not always the best people to explain. Dedicated and proficient users of a tool are often better at teaching tools than the experts.
